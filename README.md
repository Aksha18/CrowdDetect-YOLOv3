# CrowdDetect-YOLOv3

ðŸš€ An Intelligent System for Real-Time Crowd Analysis

This project leverages YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art object detection model, along with OpenCV, to detect and analyze crowds in video footage. The solution is designed to assist in areas such as public safety, traffic monitoring, and event management by providing actionable insights from real-world video datasets


Features
Object Detection: Detects multiple objects (people, vehicles, etc.) in video frames.
Real-Time Analysis: Processes video streams to identify crowd density in real-time.
Customizable Model: Built on YOLOv3, making it extendable to different datasets and applications.
